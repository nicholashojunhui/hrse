4. Run the Publisher node; publish data of your hands' motion to ROS

	$ rosrun leap_motion sender.py

5. Run node that subscribes the data from the previous node and also allows you to use hand gestures to control the TB3

	$ rosrun hrse leap_teleop.py

*ensure that your python codes are in the src folder of your hrse package
*ensure you have given permissions to your python files (1. cd to directory; 2. chmod +x name_of_python_file.py)
